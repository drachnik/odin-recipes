    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> My father showed me these mashed potatoes growing up and I can never go back</p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Potatoes: I use gold potatoes, however russet works in a pinch</li>
        <li> 1/2 Stick of butter</li>
        <li> 3 tbsp cream cheese</li>
        <li> 5-10 garlic cloves</li>
        <li> salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Direction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Peel and cut potatoes into even chunks, place the chunks and garlic into a big pot and bring to a boil. </li>
        <li> Let the potatoes cook in the boiled water for 20-30 minutes. To check if they are ready stick a fork into the potatoes if its easy to puncture most of the potatoes with little resistance, then they are ready</li>
        <li> Optional get an electric mixer, otherwise get a potato mashing device and a large pot. Drain and put the potatoes into the pot along with the butter cream cheese, and milk.</li>
        <li> Mash all the ingredients together adding salt and pepper for flavor.</li>
        <li> Consume immediately.</li>
    </ol>
